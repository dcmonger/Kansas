Kansas is a general platform for board games on mobile devices.
Its goal is to enable friends to use their smartphone, tablet, or laptop
in place of any set of cards or game pieces. Like in games using physical
pieces, Kansas assumes that players trust each other and can negotiate
movements in person.

Kansas is a work in progress.
