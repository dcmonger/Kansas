Kansas is a general platform for card games on mobile devices.
Its goal is to enable friends to use their smartphone, tablet, or laptop
in place of any set of cards. Like in games using physical cards,
Kansas is designed under the assmuption that players trust each other
and can negotiate rules and movements in person.

Kansas is a work in progress.
