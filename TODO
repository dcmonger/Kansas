High prio, perf & ui:
* render large stacks using less images
* cards in 2/3/4 stacks should be easily seen, so that stacking is useful
* make stacks re-renderable on the client-side only

High prio, perf:
* send moves in bulk requests when possible
* stacks should skew in the other direction on the other side of the board
* replace autoRefresh in selectable
* implement fast z-changes using a node pool

High prio, ui:
* disable zooming!
* get rid of "turn over", add a "move" option to STACK menu
* move card menu below stack menu - so that peek is aligned with deck
* auto show hovermenu on select - and have a "move" option
* make sure that toClientKey(toCanonicalKey(x)) == x for all x
* when crossing the midpoint, keep old orientation until completely crossed over

Low prio, ui:
* "compress" the opponent's side so that you can have more vertical space
* allow dragging to other users hands + browsing hands as a selection
* allow hand sorting, or autosorting by some property
* different colors for different user frames
* garbage collect frames / unfade cards after a period of no activity
* implement placing / discarding decks on the board
* investigate using phonegap - can have back button close hovermenu?
* save games in localstorage
* some way of choosing user id and game id
* update frames once the card has been tapped/untapped/moved
