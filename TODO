High prio, perf & ui:
* render large stacks using less images
* cards in 2/3/4 stacks should be easily seen, so that stacking is useful
* make stacks re-renderable on the client-side only

High prio, perf:
* send moves in bulk requests when possible
* replace autoRefresh in selectable
* implement fast z-changes using a node pool

High prio, ui:
* make sure that toClientKey(toCanonicalKey(x)) == x for all x

Low prio, ui:
* "compress" the opponent's side so that you can have more vertical space
* allow dragging to other users hands + browsing hands as a selection
* allow hand sorting, or autosorting by some property
* different colors for different user frames
* garbage collect frames / unfade cards after a period of no activity
* implement placing / discarding decks on the board
* investigate using phonegap - can have back button close hovermenu?
* save games in localstorage
* some way of choosing user id and game id
* update frames once the card has been tapped/untapped/moved
