High prio, perf:
* replace autoRefresh in selectable or replace selectable
* implement fast hand<->board z-changes using a node pool [difficult]
* render large stacks using less images [difficult]

High prio, ui:
* snap-to grid with dotted visualization
* tap->tap, double tap->reveal, hold->hovermenu

Low prio, ui:
* preview selected cards in hover menu
* garbage collect frames / unfade cards after a period of no activity
* "compress" the opponent's side so that you can have more vertical space
* allow dragging to other users hands + browsing hands as a selection
* allow hand sorting, or autosorting by some property
* different colors for different user frames
* implement placing / discarding decks on the board
* investigate using phonegap - can have back button close hovermenu?
* save games in localstorage
* some way of choosing user id and game id
* update frames once the card has been tapped/untapped/moved
* config language to more easily specify initial game state
