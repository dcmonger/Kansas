High prio, perf:
* consider changing images / reusing nodes to impl fast z-index changes
* investigate patching jquery ui to speed up selects (reuse the helper?)
* send moves in bulk requests when possible

High prio, ui:
* make sure that toCanonicalKey and toClientKey implement a bijection
* better stack rendering, so that cards in 2/3/4 stacks are easily seen
* enforce stack height consistency in source and destination

Low prio, ui:
* "compress" the opponent's side so that you can have more vertical space
* have decks on opponent's side stack the opposite direction?
* bind frames to cards so that when cards move the frame still is correct
* allow dragging to other users hands + browsing hands as a selection
* implement creating/destroying cards on the board
* garbage collect frames / unfade cards after a period of no activity
* allow hand sorting, or autosorting by some property
* some way of choosing user id and game id
* different colors for different user frames
* save games in localstorage
* investigate using phonegap - can have back button close hovermenu?
